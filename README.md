# BYU-IEEE-Keyboard-Project
This is the template for both the Ergogen file and the QMK firmware that the BYU IEEE club will be using to create custom keyboards.

 ## Ergogen
Ergogen is a platform that will take the dificult parts of designing a keyboard and gets you 90% of the way there with one web tool. You can use it to design a pcb, case, and face plate. One of the dificult things about it is that it recently updated to v4.0, which has breaking changes to the way it works, but the official docs hasn't been updated yet. 
## Files
A description of the differnt files in the repository
### points_demo.yaml
 - This file is the yaml for the pointmap I made live in the IEEE club. It is a good example of using metatdata and points and a rather poor example of using units. It is not perfect and should not be used as the basis of a keyboard but rather an example of how to use the funcitons and paramaters of Ergogen.
 
## QMK
Starting with the QMK docs can be really difficult. What you are going to want to do after you set up the QMK firmwar is run `qmk new-keyboard` and it will walk you through the steps of how to build your firmware.
